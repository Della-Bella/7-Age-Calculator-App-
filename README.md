# Age Calculator Project

A simple web application built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript that calculates a user's age in years, months, and days based on their entered birth date.

## Description

This project was created as part of my learning journey into JavaScript. The goal was to build a practical tool while practicing fundamental concepts like:

*   DOM manipulation (getting user input, displaying results)
*   Working with JavaScript `Date` objects
*   Basic date calculations and logic
*   Event handling (`onclick`)
*   Linking HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files

## Features

*   User-friendly date input field.
*   Calculation of age displayed in years, months, and days.
*   Prevents users from selecting a future date as their birth date.
*   Simple, clean interface.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** For the structure of the web page.
*   **CSS3:** For styling the elements and layout.
*   **Vanilla JavaScript:** For the core logic, date calculations, and interaction.

## What I Learned

Building this project helped me solidify my understanding of:

*   How to select and interact with HTML elements using JavaScript (`getElementById`).
*   How to read values from input fields (`.value`).
*   Manipulating the content of HTML elements (`.innerHTML`).
*   Performing calculations with `Date` objects (`new Date()`, `getDate()`, `getMonth()`, `getFullYear()`).
*   Handling edge cases in date calculations (like borrowing days from months or months from years).
*   The basics of deploying a static website using a service like Netlify.

## How to Use

1.  Visit the https://age-calculator-app-dellabella.netlify.app/
2.  Select your birth date using the date picker.
3.  Click the "Calculate your Age" button.
4.  Your calculated age will appear below the button.
